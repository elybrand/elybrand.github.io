I am a third year mathematics Ph.D. student at the University
of California, San Diego. [Rayan Saab](http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~rsaab/) is my adviser.
I received my bachelorâ€™s degree in mathematics at the University of Georgia in 2015.
For anyone who is interested, a copy of my [CV]({{ "/assets/files/cv.pdf" | absolute_url }})
or my [resume]({{ "/assets/files/resume.pdf" | absolute_url }}) can be found here.

### Research Interests
My research interests lay primarily in random matrix theory and signal processing. 
In the non-asymptotic case, I'm interested in random matrix ensembles as seen in the compressed sensing literature as 
well as non-linear random measurement operators which appear in the phase retrieval setting.
I am also interested in the asymptotic case, where one uses tools from free probability and
operator algebra to study the empirical spectral distributions of random linear operators.

Lately, the signal processing group at UCSD has been going over recent advancements in deep learning
from the perspective of applied harmonic analysis. I've written a [blog post]({{ "/sparse_net/" | absolute_url }}) about one of the papers
we read last spring if you're looking for a nice introduction.

As an undergraduate, I worked with [Jason Cantarella](https://www.jasoncantarella.com/wordpress/)
on computational knot theory. I plan on writing a blog post about this when I have time, so stay
tuned!
